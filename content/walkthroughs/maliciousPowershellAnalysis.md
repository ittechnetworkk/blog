In this write-up, I‚Äôll be investigating a challenge named [**Malicious PowerShell Analysis**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/challenge/malicious-powershell-analysis-bf6b52faef) from Blue Team Labs Online. This challenge isn‚Äôt particularly difficult, making it a great exercise for learning or sharpening malware analysis skills.

### üß™ **Step 1: Downloading the File**

First, I downloaded the malicious file to an isolated analysis environment (virtual machine).

The file came as an encrypted ZIP archive named:

![maliciousPowershellAnalysis](/images/Walkthroughs/MaliciousPowershellAnalysis/1.png)

### üîç **Step 2: Hash Analysis**

To begin the investigation, I calculated the file‚Äôs MD5 hash using `md5sum`, then submitted it to multiple threat intelligence platforms:

- **VirusTotal**
- **Hybrid Analysis**
- **AnyRun**

Then paste it.

‚úÖ **VirusTotal**

VirusTotal is one of the most comprehensive platforms for scanning files, hashes, and domains. It also provides detailed information under multiple sections.

An important observation here is the ‚ÄúLast Analysis Date‚Äù‚Äîit shows that this file was last scanned 7 months ago. Therefore, I clicked the ‚ÄúReanalyze‚Äù button to get updated results.

Now we can gather a lot of information about that file.

Let's see what's going on in the other platforms.

üß† **Hybrid Analysis**

Hybrid Analysis is another powerful tool that provides detailed insight into files, hashes, domains, and IPs. It helps identify malicious behavior, indicators of compromise, and more.

##### üß™ **AnyRun**

AnyRun is a sandbox platform that lets you analyze files, URLs, or hashes in real-time or view reports from previous executions. It provides behavioral analysis that‚Äôs often very revealing.

Now let's have a look to the challenge submissions and start off with first question.

Next, I needed to analyze the actual PowerShell script inside `ps_script.txt`. To do this, I used **`olevba`**, a tool designed for extracting and analyzing malicious VBA macros.

![maliciousPowershellAnalysis](/images/Walkthroughs/MaliciousPowershellAnalysis/14.png)

The PowerShell code appeared heavily obfuscated and Base64-encoded. I used [**CyberChef**](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode it.

Before decoding, I removed the initial line starting with `powershell`.

![maliciousPowershellAnalysis](/images/Walkthroughs/MaliciousPowershellAnalysis/15.png)

After decoding the Base64 content, the result was still difficult to read. So, I pasted it into Sublime Text, then replaced all:

- `'` with nothing
- `+` with nothing

This gave me a more readable version of the script:

### üß© **Challenge Questions and Answers**


We will export answers from this code.

The answer of first question can be noticeable in this code.

### **Question 1**

**What security protocol is being used for the communication with a malicious domain?**

```
sEcuRITYproTocol"=Tls12
```

**Answer:** `TLS 1.2`


### **Question 2**

**What directory does the obfuscated PowerShell create? (Starting from \HOME\)**

```
$HOME{0}Db_bh30{0}Yf5be5g{0}
```

`{0}` represents the backslash (`\`) in the obfuscation.

**Answer:** `\HOME\Db_bh30\Yf5be5g\`


### **Question 3**

**What file is being downloaded (full name)?**

```
$Swrp6tc=A69S;
...
$Imd1yck=...$Swrp6tc.dll;
```

This suggests a DLL named `A69S.dll` is being created or downloaded.

**Answer:** `A69S.dll`

### **Question 4**

**What is used to execute the downloaded file?**

```
Get-Item $Imd1yck."lenGTH"-ge35698 {&rundll32
```

This shows that the file is executed using `rundll32`.

**Answer:** `rundll32`


### **Question 5**

**What is the domain name of the URI ending in ‚Äò/6F2gd/‚Äô**

```
wm.mcdevelop.net/content/6F2gd/
```

**Answer:** `wm.mcdevelop.net`


### **Question 6**

**Based on the analysis of the obfuscated code, what is the name of the malware?**

Using the domain `wm.mcdevelop.net`, I searched in multiple threat intel sources and found that it's associated with the **Emotet** malware family.

**Answer:** `emotet`
