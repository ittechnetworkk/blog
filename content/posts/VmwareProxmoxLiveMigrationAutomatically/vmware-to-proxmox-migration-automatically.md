Hi everyone, in this article I will discuss the second way of migration from VMware to Proxmox.

It is of course easier and more effortless than the manual way.

The migration process will be as follows.

As you can see, the VM has been successfully imported automatically. However, you should install the necessary drivers and remove VMware Tools from the VM when you import a Windows machine.

Thank you for taking the time to read this article. I hope you found it helpful.

Keep up the great work.
